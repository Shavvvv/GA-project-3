 This is a social music  sharing web application made utilizing my knowlege of MERN stack development. Its purpose is allow you to share songs you like with others. The application also allows you to like posts by other users  as well. A user will have the ability to Create,view and delete posts, as well as like another post.

## Moving Forward...

I plan on rendering the web app more functionality such as:
* CLEAN UP CODE ---> sorry in advance @Megan @Jim
* Clear the state of the Form after Post has been created.
* Allowing the user to perform CRUD operations on their personal information, an throughout other aspects of the application.
* A category option, where it will filter out different posts based on their genres
* API Implementation to allow users search songs and use the data provided to autofill a post creation. 
* Style Page 
* Propper Navigation
* Adding a profile page,  where you can see both the posts you've made, as well as your likes, so you can add the likes post to a "will listen to" list
